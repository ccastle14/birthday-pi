# birthday-pi
A project for a Raspberry Pi powered e-ink display that automatically fetches upcoming birthdays from Google Calendar and displays them!

I have this set up as a cron job that runs nightly on a raspberry pi connected to a Waveshare e-ink display. It displays birthdays that are entered in Google Calendar in a format like "Jake Birthday". It will NOT display birthdays off of a contact's birthday. This way, you can set anyone's contact birthday, but for them to show up on the display, you must have an event for it - the idea being that you only want a select group of people showing up on this reminder device.
